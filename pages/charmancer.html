                    <p>This is a character maker for your characters in the world of Isekais.</p>
                    <p>Follow the instructions set out in each section and at the end, it will produce your results for you.</p>

                    <h2>How to use</h2>
                    <p>By default, Players will be given 8 on all their skills. This will essentially be the player's base skills given by having the base classes; Mathematics, English and Science.</p>
                    <p>Players will then be allowed to select 5 classes. Of the 5 chosen classes, players will select a "Favourite" and 2 classes they "Dislike"</p>
                    <p>For your favourite class you will receive double to each skill and receive expertise in the proficiency section but only one of the two not both<br>
                    And your favourite class will also give you proficiency in those two skill saving throws. You will not receive skill proficiencies from your "Disliked" classes</p>
                    <p><i>Note: You may not choose more than 2 classes which have the same major stat, for example you may not select 3 classes which all have Int +2 in them</i></p>
